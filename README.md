### how to use
- install [C++ library for Telegram bot API](https://github.com/reo7sp/tgbot-cpp#dependencies)
- `git clone https://github.com/arashnm80/nm80-dictionary-bot`
- `cd build`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`

**note:**
This is my first telegram bot and for now it's only supposed to work.
I'll do the improvements and modifications later.
